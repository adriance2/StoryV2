        <h2>Childhood Experiences</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="files/game1.jpeg" class="float-left" alt="Childhood">My childhood was full of adventures and learning, from watching movies and documentaries to playing games. The first game I ever played was Pokémon on my GameBoy Advance when I was around four years old. I played it over and over until I got my next game, Final Fantasy V Advance. As a child, I didn’t fully understand the story, but I was still captivated by its world and gameplay.<br><br><br><br><img src="files/game2.jpeg" class="float-left" alt="Childhood"> Even though I struggled to grasp the deeper aspects of the plot, I enjoyed exploring the game, battling enemies, and discovering new places. It sparked my curiosity and made me appreciate storytelling in games. Looking back, those moments shaped my love for gaming and taught me patience and problem-solving, even at a young age.

        <h2>Elementary Days</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="files/elem.jpeg" class="float-left" alt="Elementary">As I entered elementary school, my love for Pokémon never faded. I eagerly played every new game I could get my hands on, memorizing different Pokémon, their evolutions, and abilities. This passion eventually led me to drawing—I wanted to recreate my favorite characters on paper, sketching them from game guides and trading cards. At first, my drawings were rough, but with practice, I got better and improved a lot compared to my earlier sketches.

Aside from gaming and drawing, I also became more active in sports and chess. Chess, in particular, challenged me to think ahead and plan my moves carefully, much like in the games I loved. Balancing these interests, I found joy in both the creative and strategic sides of life, shaping the person I was becoming.</p>

        <h2>High School Experience</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="files/hs.png" class="float-left" alt="High School">In high school, my interests continued to grow and evolve. While my love for Pokémon and drawing remained, I also got into anime, which introduced me to a whole new world of storytelling and art styles. I was fascinated by the way anime blended detailed backgrounds with expressive characters, and it inspired me to improve my own artwork. I began incorporating the landscape drawing techniques I had learned before into my anime-style art, creating scenes that felt more immersive and dynamic.
<br><br><br><br><img src="files/hs1.jpeg" class="float-left" alt="High School">
At the same time, I became more interested in academics, especially in technology. My school didn’t offer many computer-related subjects, but I took Computer Systems Servicing (CSS) since it was the only option available. It wasn’t exactly focused on programming, but it gave me a foundation in computer hardware and troubleshooting. This exposure sparked my curiosity about computers and pushed me to explore more on my own, setting the stage for my future in computer engineering.

        <h2>College</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><img src="files/col1.jpg" class="float-left" alt="College">During the pandemic, I lost my passion for art and found myself focusing more on games. The uncertainty of those times made gaming an escape, something familiar and comforting. I spent countless hours exploring different worlds, enjoying the challenges and stories they offered. However, as much as I loved gaming, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing.
<br><br><br><br><img src="files/col.jpg" class="float-left" alt="College">
When I entered college, I felt a strong desire to regain my passion for art, even though I had lost much of the skill I had developed in high school. Picking up a pencil again felt unfamiliar, and my drawings weren’t as refined as before, but I knew I wanted to improve. At the same time, my interest in computers and gaming deepened. I became more curious about how games were made, how software worked, and the logic behind it all. This growing fascination pushed me further into the world of computer engineering, where I found new ways to combine my love for creativity and technology.
